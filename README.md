## Description

The idea for this app is to be able to fill out forms with data from RAWES assessments and easily create visual data representation of various types to interpret and communicate the data more easily

There are currently 3 tabs
- Info: about RAWES
- Enter Data: The RAWES sheet to fill out. There are default services, but this is customisable
- Pie Chart: Placeholder tab for a pie chart breakdown of service type

The RAWES sheet is split into 4 sections for the 4 types of service: Provisioning, Regulating, Cultural, Supporting.

## Usage

To fill out the form:
- Click on the `Enter Data` tab
- Click the red `-` button to remove a row
- Click the green`+` button to add a new row
- Enter the name of the new service in the `service` column
- Use the checkboxes to choose the value of the benfit or disbenefit
- Click `submit` at the bottom of the page to update the graphs

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Local Storage / JSON

## Future Development Options

- Add ways to submit multiple forms with different dates, and track changes over time
- Add statistical data representations such as pie and bar charts
- Split data based on scale (e.g. local, regional, global)
- Research whether services with 0 value are included in calculations or omitted
- Add local storage in which data from each form submitted is stored in one object
